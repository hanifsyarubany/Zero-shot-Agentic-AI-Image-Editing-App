# Agentic AI Image Editor: Building a Multi-Turn, Multi-Agent Image Editing Stack

This repository implements a zero-shot image editing pipeline that unites multimodal reasoning, segmentation, and generative inpainting. Built on recent advances in vision–language models, the system translates natural instructions into grounded visual edits—supporting both text-guided and image-guided editing with minimal manual effort.

## 🧠 Key Components

- **MCP Orchestration**: MLLM Planner on MCP client, tools on MCP server, streaming via SSE.  
- **Planner and Router**: Composes multistep jobs from a single query, selects and orders tools.  
- **Session Memory**: Stores checkpoints, regions, masks, and references; supports rollbacks and multi-turn continuity.  
- **Vision Grounding**: Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning over instructions and mapping them to image regions.  
- **Zero-Shot Segmentation**: SAM-2 guided by text, bounding boxes, or points, refined for crisp masks.  
- **Prompt Builders & Conditioning**:  
  - MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Llama-4) for segmentation and diffusion prompts  
  - IP-Adapter for reference image conditioning  
- **Editing Engines**:  
  - PrefPaint (SDXL-based) for human-aligned inpainting  
  - SDXL Inpaint / IP-SDXL for reference-driven edits  
  - ObjectClear for clean removals and background fill  
  - NVLabs Add-it for object insertion via diffusion  
  - CatVTON for garment try-on tasks  
- **Text & UI Tools**: PIL-based text drawer (auto-fit) and bounding-box renderer.  
- **Intermediate Store & Trace**: Saves outputs per step, enables partial undo and auditability.

## ⚙️ Reproducing the Environment

```bash
# Clone the VisionReasoner base repository
git clone https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionReasoner.git
cd VisionReasoner

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n image_editing python=3.12
conda activate image_editing

# Install dependencies
pip3 install torch torchvision
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter.git
pip install diffusers groq huggingface-hub python-dotenv
pip install uvicorn fastapi streamlit
```
---
## 📦 IP-Adapter Checkpoints
The IP-Adapter checkpoints must be downloaded manually. Make sure to place the correct path in your code when loading the adapter.
```bash
mkdir IP-Adapter
cd IP-Adapter
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

Once you've set up the environment and downloaded the required models, you can launch both MCP (server & client) and frontend with the following commands:

#### ✅ Run the MCP Server
```bash
python -m MCP_Server.mcp_server
```
#### ✅ Run the MCP Client
```bash
uvicorn MCP_Client.mcp_client:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
#### ✅ Run the Frontend (Chainlit)
```bash
chainlit run MCP_Client/frontend.py --port 8885
```

## ⚠️ Caution

This project requires **a high-end GPU with at least 48 GB of VRAM** to run all models (e.g., Vision Reasoner, SAM-2, and PrefPaint, IP-Adapter, CatVTON, Add-it, ObjectClear) efficiently in memory.

If you attempt to run this pipeline on hardware with less VRAM, you may encounter:
- Out-of-memory (OOM) errors
- Slow or failed inferences
- Inability to load large vision-language models

> 🖥️ This setup was tested using an **6x NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 (48GB VRAM)**. Performance may vary on different hardware.
